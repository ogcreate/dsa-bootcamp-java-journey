check my current work Create flowchart and pseudocode for the following:
1. Input a year and find whether it is a leap year or not.
2. Take two numbers and print the sum of both.
3. Take a number as input and print the multiplication table for it.
4. Take 2 numbers as inputs and find their HCF and LCM.
5. Keep taking numbers as inputs till the user enters ‘x’, after that print sum of all.

This is created in gitbash using vi pseudocode.txt

PSEUDOCODE
==========

1. Input a year and find whether it is a leap year or not.
Start
        input year
        if year % 4 = 0 and year modulo 100 != 0 or year modulo 400 = 0
                print leap year
        else
                not leap year
End

2. Take two numbers and print the sum of both.
Start
        input number1, number2
        sum = numer1 + number2
        print sum
End

3. Take a number as input and print the multiplication table for it.
Start
        input number
                for i = 0; i <= 12;
                        print num * i
                i++
End

4. Take 2 numbers as inputs and find their HCF and LCM.
Start
        input number1 and number2
